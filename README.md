# Differential-Gene-Expression-Analysis-
<br>
Author: Oshaa
<br>
This code performs a basic Differential Gene Expression Analysis using a gene expression dataset with only Python standard tools:
<br>
Pandas
<br>
Numpy
<br>
Matplotlib
<br>
It calculates:
<br>
- Mean expression for control and treated samples
<br>
- Log2 fold change
<br>
- Dummy p-values (or real ones if provided)
<br>
- Identification of significantly upregulated/downregulated genes
<br>
- Volcano plot for visualization
